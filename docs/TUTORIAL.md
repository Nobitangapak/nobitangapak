I will publish a tutorial soon. A mini-project will serve as practice in the tutorial. The project is a desktop application that generates prime numbers. In the project, I will demonstrate how to use the power of pyrustic.com and pyrustic.threadom to make separate components communicate. The tutorial should allow you to start using Pyrustic with confidence.

If you are interested in the project and wish to be notified of the launch of the tutorial, contact me.
